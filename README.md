# Thesis Allocation
Every year, we have thesis projects proposed by companies and Cranfield School of Management faculty for our MSc Logistics and Supply Chain Management and MSc Strategic Marketing students. We present these thesis projects to our students and ask them to state their preferences towards these thesis projects. Depending on the number of students, we may ask the students to put forward up to 10 preferences. 

We then run a mixed integer linear programming code that allocates projects to students according to students' preferences. The objective is to assign as early preference (e.g. first preference, second preference) as possible. The problem is always a function of the number of students participating in the allocation exercise and their specific preferences.

This folder contains the mixed integer linear programming code that we use to perform thesis allocation and a sample data.
